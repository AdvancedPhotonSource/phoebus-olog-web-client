# Olog es web client

This project provides a web client for the olog es logbook service. The objective is to provide read, write and search capabilities, but is not as feature rich as the olog es client contained in the CS Studio client, see https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus

Tehe olog es web client is based upon React JS framework.
